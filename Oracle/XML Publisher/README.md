# ðŸ“„ Oracle XML Publisher (BI Publisher) â€“ Overview & Usage

## What is Oracle XML Publisher?

Oracle XML Publisher, now known as **Oracle BI Publisher**, is a reporting and document generation tool designed to create, manage, and deliver highly formatted reports and documents from multiple data sources. It separates data extraction from report layout, allowing flexible report design using familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Excel, and Adobe Acrobat.

## How XML Publisher Works

1. **Data Extraction:** Extract data using SQL, XML, Web Services, or BI Reports.  
2. **Template Design:** Create report templates with placeholders for data fields.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use clear, modular templates for easy maintenance.

- Leverage bursting to reduce report run-time and personalize output.  
- Schedule off-peak report runs for heavy reports.  
- Secure sensitive data with appropriate roles and permissions.

## Example Scenario

Create a simple **Employee List Report** displaying employee IDs, names, and their departments.

---

## Step 1: Data Extraction

Use the following SQL query to fetch the employee data:

```sql
SELECT
  employee_id,
  first_name || ' ' || last_name AS employee_name,
  department_name
FROM
  employees e
JOIN
  departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY
  employee_name;

## Step 2: Create Data Model
    In Oracle BI Publisher, define a Data Set based on the above SQL query.
    Optionally, define parameters to filter data (e.g., by department).

## Step 3: Design Report Template
    Use BI Publisher Desktop (Word add-in) to create a report template.
    Insert placeholders for the data fields such as:
    <?employee_id?>
    <?employee_name?>
    <?department_name?>
    Format the data into tables or lists as needed.

## Step 4: Upload Template and Data Model
    Upload the data model and template files to Oracle BI Publisher web interface or Oracle Cloud.
    Associate the uploaded template with the data model.

## Step 5: Run the Report
    Execute the report in BI Publisher.
    The system merges the data extracted from the SQL query with your template.
    Reports can be generated in various formats like PDF, Excel, or HTML.
