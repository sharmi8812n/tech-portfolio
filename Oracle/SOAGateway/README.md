## EmployeeServiceGateway - SOA Gateway Sample Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Employee Management Service using SOA Gateway. The service allows you to:
    Get employee details by ID
    Add a new employee
    Update an employee's salary
The SOA Gateway acts as a middleware layer exposing backend services (like databases or SOAP services) as REST or SOAP endpoints, making integration with external systems seamless.

## What is SOA Gateway?
    SOA Gateway is part of Oracle SOA Suite.
    It enables you to expose business logic as standardized web services (REST or SOAP).
    Provides routing, transformation, and orchestration between different systems.
    Allows easy integration of backend applications (databases, ERP, legacy systems) with modern consumers.
