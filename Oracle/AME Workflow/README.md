# ðŸ“„ Oracle AME (Approval Management Engine) Workflow â€“ Overview

## What is AME?

**Approval Management Engine (AME)** is Oracleâ€™s flexible, rule-based workflow engine designed to automate and manage approval processes across Oracle Cloud applications, especially in **Oracle HCM**, **Financials**, **Procurement**, and other modules.

## Key Features

- **Rule-Based Approvals:** Define dynamic approval rules based on transaction attributes like amount, department, location, or custom criteria.
- **Configurable Workflows:** Easily create, test, and deploy approval flows without coding.
- **Delegation & Escalation:** Support for delegating approvals and automatic escalation on timeout.
- **Multiple Approver Types:** Support for single, group, parallel, or sequential approvals.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Oracle Cloud SaaS applications.
- **Audit & Tracking:** Complete audit trail of approval history for compliance.

## How AME Workflow Works

1. **Transaction Initiation:** A transaction (e.g., expense report, requisition, leave request) triggers the AME approval process.
2. **Rule Evaluation:** AME evaluates the configured rules based on transaction data.
3. **Approver Determination:** AME dynamically determines the approvers based on roles, hierarchies, or attribute values.
4. **Approval Routing:** The transaction is routed to the approvers in sequence or parallel as defined.
5. **Approval Actions:** Approvers can approve, reject, request changes, or delegate.
6. **Completion:** Once all approvals are complete, the transaction proceeds to the next step or finalization.

## Setting Up AME Workflow

### Step 1: Define Approval Rules
- Use AME Rule Designer (in Setup and Maintenance or HCM Setup).
- Create rules based on transaction attributes (amount, job role, location).

### Step 2: Configure Rule Hierarchies
- Define how rules are prioritized and nested.
- Support for default rules if no specific match is found.

### Step 3: Assign Rules to Transactions
- Link AME rules to specific business processes (e.g., expense reports, purchase requisitions).

### Step 4: Test and Activate
- Use the AME testing tools to simulate approval flows.
- Activate the rules once validated.
