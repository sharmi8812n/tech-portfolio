Step-by-Step Guide

1. Set Up Oracle JDeveloper
Before importing the project, ensure that Oracle JDeveloper is set up for OAF development:
Download JDeveloper Patch: Obtain the appropriate JDeveloper patch for your EBS version. For example, patch p8431482_R12_GENERIC.zip is suitable for EBS R12.
Extract the Patch: Unzip the patch to a directory, e.g., D:\DevSuiteHome_1\jdev.
Set Environment Variables: Define the JDEV_USER_HOME environment variable to point to the jdev directory within the extracted patch.
Copy DBC File: Obtain the dbc file from the $FND_TOP/secure directory on the EBS server and place it in the dbc_files/secure directory within the JDeveloper setup.

2. Import the Project into JDeveloper
Open JDeveloper: Launch Oracle JDeveloper.
Import Project: Go to File > Open, navigate to the location of the extracted ZIP file, and select the project to import.
Build the Project: Right-click on the project and select Rebuild to compile the project.

3. Deploy the OAF Page
Generate JAR File: After building the project, generate a JAR file containing the compiled classes.
Transfer Files to EBS Server: Use tools like WinSCP to transfer the JAR file and any other necessary files to the appropriate directories on the EBS server.
Run Import Script: Execute the import script on the EBS server to register the new page and components.

4. Access the OAF Page
Assign Responsibility: Ensure that the appropriate responsibility is assigned to your user account to access the new page.
Navigate to the Page: Use the EBS interface to navigate to the new page and verify its functionality.
